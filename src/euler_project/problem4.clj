;;    A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from
;;    the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
;;
;;    Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
;;
;; "3-digit number" is not defined explicitly here, so I'll assume that it means
;; any integer in the range [100,999].
